# Bike-Sharing-Case-Study
Implemented a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict shared bike demand, featuring Recursive Feature Elimination for optimal variable selection. This predictive model serves as a valuable resource for management, offering insights into demand variations across various features.


We were required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It was intended to be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands varied with different features. They could accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Furthermore, the model was a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
